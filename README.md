## Front End Developer Assessment Task

## Overview

This project is a Front-End task that involves building a full working Create/Read/Delete functionality using ReactJS or React-TS. The API should connect with Mockapi.io.

## Features

1. **Reusable Components**: All components are designed to be reusable.
2. **Dynamic Styles**: Styles like Fontsize, FontWeight, Width, Height, etc., are dynamic and get through props.
3. **UI Design**: The design is based on a FIGMA design and should be an exact clone in terms of Spacing, Sizing, Color, Padding, Margin, etc.
4. **API Integration**: Axios is used for API integration.
5. **Clean Code Base**: The codebase is clean, and no unused code is present.
6. **Error Validation**: Error validation is present for the create and edit parts, especially for mandatory fields.
7. **Separation of Concerns**: Constant values are in a separate file, and the mutation (API requests) is maintained in a separate file.
8. **CSS**: Only the Tailwind CSS library is used for styling.
9. **Additional Libraries**: HeadlessUI and Heroicons can be used if needed.

## Deliverables
 
- The design also follows exact pixel padding and spacing as indicated by red and blue lines in the design.
